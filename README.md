Title:  WHAT'S IN MY CLOSET???

The "What's in my closet???" app is going to be used to track what my wife does or doesn't have in her closet.  At this point in time, it doesn't matter as we are all probably wearing the same clothes day in and day out with COVID19.  The original idea is to track what is at the dry cleaners so she will know what she currently doesn't have in the closet.  

Once a piece of clothing is chosen she should be able to scan the QR code assigned to the piece of clothing and scan it out of the list into an outbox.  Once the clothing comes back from the dry cleaners the clothing will be scanned back into the item list in where it is assigned too. 

In the end, this app may not even be used as work/life structure has totally changed in the last 2 months.
